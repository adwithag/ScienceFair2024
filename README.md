## Smart Screening for Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors: AI Meets Drug Discovery

### Abstract  
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism, and their inhibition can lead to adverse drug-drug interactions. Accurate prediction of CYP450 inhibition is essential for early-stage drug discovery and toxicity assessment. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop a machine learning-based approach using the XGBoost algorithm to predict the inhibitory potential of molecules on seven major CYP450 isoforms. Separate models were built for each enzyme using molecular descriptors and fingerprint-based features, leveraging publicly available datasets from TDCommons.ai. The models were trained and evaluated to assess their predictive performance, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-driven CYP450 inhibition screening. Our results highlight the power of AI-driven screening in drug metabolism research, providing a scalable and interpretable solution for identifying potential CYP450 inhibitors. This approach can be integrated into early-stage drug development pipelines, enhancing the efficiency of lead optimization and reducing the risk of adverse interactions. While this study serves as an initial validation of the approach, future work will focus on refining the models with experimental datasets to enhance real-world applicability.
